# Print Facility Orders Endpoint Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical issue where the print facility orders endpoint was returning empty arrays, preventing orders from displaying in the Print Shop Completion tool when a facility was selected.

## Problem Identified

### **Symptoms**
- Print Shop Completion tool showed no orders when selecting a facility
- API endpoint `/api/print-facilities/:facilityId/orders` returned empty arrays `[]`
- Frontend `fetchFacilityData` function received empty data
- Users could not see orders assigned to selected facilities

### **Root Cause**
The SQL query parameter order was incorrect in the backend endpoint. The query expected parameters in this order:

```sql
-- Query structure:
-- 1. completionStatus for completedItems count
-- 2. completionStatus for pendingItems count  
-- 3. facilityId for WHERE clause
-- 4. order status for PRINTING
-- 5. order status for ASSIGNED
```

But the parameters array was in the wrong order:
```javascript
// WRONG - Parameters in incorrect order
[facilityId, ORDER_STATUS.PRINTING, ORDER_STATUS.ASSIGNED, COMPLETION_STATUS.COMPLETED, COMPLETION_STATUS.PENDING]
```

## Solution Implemented

### **Fixed Parameter Order**
```javascript
// CORRECT - Parameters now match query structure
[COMPLETION_STATUS.COMPLETED, COMPLETION_STATUS.PENDING, facilityId, ORDER_STATUS.PRINTING, ORDER_STATUS.ASSIGNED]
```

### **Files Modified**

#### **`server.js`**
- **Line 631**: Fixed parameter order in `GET /api/print-facilities/:facilityId/orders` endpoint
- **Query**: `SELECT o.*, COUNT(oi.id) as totalItems, COUNT(CASE WHEN oi.completionStatus = ? THEN 1 END) as completedItems, COUNT(CASE WHEN oi.completionStatus = ? THEN 1 END) as pendingItems FROM orders o LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.orderId WHERE o.printFacilityId = ? AND o.status IN (?, ?) GROUP BY o.id ORDER BY o.assignedAt DESC`

## Testing and Verification

### **Before Fix**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/print-facilities/21344396-afdd-478d-a4b5-e1640ebb1024/orders"
# Result: []
```

### **After Fix**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/print-facilities/21344396-afdd-478d-a4b5-e1640ebb1024/orders"
# Result: [{"id":"468e8f3a-964d-4be8-a4b5-e1640ebb1024","orderNumber":"ORD-003",...}, {"id":"7275bb02-64be-4ed2-9941-09f6a58fcbeb","orderNumber":"ORD-001",...}]
```

### **Endpoints Verified Working**
- ✅ `/api/print-facilities/:facilityId/orders` - Returns facility orders with counts
- ✅ `/api/print-facilities/:facilityId/order-items` - Returns facility order items
- ✅ Frontend now displays orders when facility is selected

## Impact

### **High Priority**
- **Critical Fix**: Restored core functionality of Print Shop Completion tool
- **User Experience**: Users can now see and work with orders assigned to facilities
- **Workflow**: Print shop staff can now complete their daily tasks

### **Affected Features**
- **Print Shop Completion Tool**: Orders now display correctly
- **Facility Order Management**: Staff can see assigned orders
- **Order Item Completion**: Individual items can be marked as completed
- **Completion Photo Assignment**: Photos can be matched to visible orders

## Technical Details

### **SQL Query Structure**
The endpoint performs a complex query that:
1. **Joins** orders with order_items
2. **Counts** total items, completed items, and pending items
3. **Filters** by facility ID and order status
4. **Groups** results by order
5. **Orders** by assignment date

### **Parameter Mapping**
```javascript
// Query placeholders: ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
// Parameters: [COMPLETION_STATUS.COMPLETED, COMPLETION_STATUS.PENDING, facilityId, ORDER_STATUS.PRINTING, ORDER_STATUS.ASSIGNED]
// Mapping:
// ?1 → COMPLETION_STATUS.COMPLETED (for completedItems count)
// ?2 → COMPLETION_STATUS.PENDING (for pendingItems count)  
// ?3 → facilityId (for WHERE clause)
// ?4 → ORDER_STATUS.PRINTING (for status IN clause)
// ?5 → ORDER_STATUS.ASSIGNED (for status IN clause)
```

## Prevention

### **Best Practices**
- **Parameter Order**: Always verify SQL query parameter order matches the array
- **Testing**: Test API endpoints after making changes
- **Documentation**: Document complex queries with parameter mapping
- **Code Review**: Have team members review SQL parameter changes

### **Future Considerations**
- **Query Builder**: Consider using a query builder to prevent parameter order issues
- **Unit Tests**: Add tests for API endpoints to catch similar issues
- **Parameter Validation**: Add validation to ensure parameter counts match

## Related Issues

This fix was part of the larger OpenCV.js to Sharp migration, but the parameter order issue was independent of that change. The endpoint was broken due to the enum value updates that changed the parameter structure.
